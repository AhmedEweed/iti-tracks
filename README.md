# ITI Subjects scraper  

ITI is the most prestigious institute in Egypt for technology teaching  
I faced a problem getting their subject names for a certain track  
So, I made this scraper to help me solve this problem.  

I scraped the names of the subjects of each track of the current batch using this script [main_scrape.py](main_scrape.py)  
and made a humble user interface to simplify the process for any user  
## Getting started

Simply clone the repo and open [GUI.py](GUI.py) file in a terminal  
and interact with the interface to get your chosen track's subjects names right in a text file  
## Prerequisites

you should know how to run a python script from the terminal  
you should have at least python 3.4 or higher installed  
and for sure you must have all the libraries imported installed!
